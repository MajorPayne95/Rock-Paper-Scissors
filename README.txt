This is a console based game of Rock Paper Scissors.

The game first selects the CPU choice between rock, paper, and scissors.  
It then prompts the user to input their choice, which is case insensitive.
If the user does not enter a valid option, they will be told "Invalid choice" and will have them re-enter an option.
Once both options are selected, the algorithm will compare the choices to determine a winner.
This will repeat for 5 rounds, at which point a winner is announced.
If a round is a tie, it will be an ignored round and will not count towards the 5 total rounds.
